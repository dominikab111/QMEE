MMV Question

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) 
                ------------------
		P(B)

P(disease|positive) = P(disease) * P(positive|disease)
		            ----------------------------------------
	P(disease)P(positive|disease) + P(nodisease)P(positive|nodisease)

P(disease|positive) = (0.01) (1)
		      --------------------         = 0.167 or ~ 17%
		(0.01) (1) + (0.99) (0.05)

	

The probability that the person from the population have MMV is 16.7 or ~17%.

After learning that my friend has a positive rapid test for MMV, I could infer that they have an 83.3% chance of being negative. I would strongly encourage that my friend gets a second test or a third rapid test to confirm whether or not they have MMV. Getting re-tested would allow them to gather more assumptions prior to coming to the conclusion they have acquired the virus and are ill. I would also suggest that the testing be improved for MMV to ensure accuracy of results.
