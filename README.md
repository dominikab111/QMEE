# Assignment 1
The data set I have for this weeks assignment includes a taxanomy table, asv table and sample map. It is a data set from a previous cross-sectional study in the Bowdish lab, conducted during 2016-2018 to observe the compositional changes in the anterior nares and oral cavity of the upper respiratory tract (URT) pre- and post-respiratory infections. The sample map includes the ID numbers, age, sex, sample type and time point of donation in 44 individuals. Samples were provided from nasal and saliva swabs, and were collected during Baseline (September to November), Infection (or 'Event', October to February) and Follow Up (March to August). The data was sequenced with 16S rRNA sequencing in the v3 and v4 region of both the nasal and saliva samples. A few biological questions I have for this data set include, "Does the URT microbiome of older individuals re-stabilize after infection?", "How do compositional changes in the URT microbiome contribute to respiratory infections?" and "How does the URT microbiome stability fluctuate pre- and post- infection within young and older individuals? "

# Assignment 2
I would like to investigate age-related changes of the URT microbiome within healthy adults. I would investigate these changes with stability over different time points using alpha and beta diversity measurements. I would also investigate compositional changes within the URT microbiome of healthy adults using taxonomic bar plots. I would divide these investigations into the following components:

1. ALpha diversity measurements between Baseline and Follow Up samples of healthy adults.
2. Beta diversity measurements between 18-39 (young), 40-64(mid aged), and 65+ (older) adults at Baseline.
3. Beta diversity measurements between healthy adults at nasal and oral sample sites.
4. Taxonomic bar plots to investigate compositional changes at Baseline and between Baseline and Follow Up samples.
5. Taxonomic bar plots between Baseline and Infection (or 'Event') samples to assess changes in microbial dominance during respiratory infections.
