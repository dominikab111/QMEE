Hypothesis 1a: Are the nasal and saliva swabs compositionally different from one another due to sampling site? 
  Hypothesis 1b:Are the nasal and saliva swabs compositionally different from one another due to sex(M/F)?
  In order to test this hypothesis, I performed a permutation test using the adonis function and bray - curtis dissimilarity as the distance measure.
I used adonis because it allows for a formal partitioning across a multivariate data set to compare community composition within the sample sites. 
The results indicate there is an 18% variation and 0.83% variation between the samples that is accounted for by sample type and sex(m/f), respectively. 
There is statistical significance with a p-value of <= 0.001*** and <= 0.029*, therefore I would fail to reject both of the null hypotheses.

Hypothesis 2: Does diversity vary over sampling time (Baseline versus Follow Up)?
  In order to test this hypothesis I used a Brute force permutation test and used alpha diversity, Shannon metric as the diversity measure.
I calculated the difference between means of alpha diversity for each sample and sampling time point: Baseline (Oct-Dec) vs Follow Up (April-June).
The results indicate there is a strong correlation between diversity and time, with a two- tailed p-value of >= 0.0009999, therefore I would fail
to reject the null hypothesis.
