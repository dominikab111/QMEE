Assignment 6 - Discussion

For the purpose of this assignment I created a generalized linear model (GLM) to test if a model predicting alpha diversity based on age and/or sample type is sufficient, and compared it to a linear model.My response variable is alpha diversity and it is a continuous variable. Due to this, I used family=Gamma(link="log") as my link funciton and overdispersion is not a concern.

I then compared the GLM to a LM using the log of alpha diversity. I used diagnostic plots to observe the results, and they were quite similar between the two models, with slightly different p values, but the significance remained the same.

**BMB**: you should really avoid comparing models on the basis of their p-values. See if they tell you a different story either in terms of the diagnostics (are the assumptions of one model closer to being satisfied than the other, or conversely is one model more problematic than the other?). Strictly speaking this is probably the only comparison you should make between the models, because anything else is likely to lead you to cherry-picking the one you prefer. However, you *could* use different models to compare the *quantitative* or *biological* stories they tell you about the data.  Just comparing "neither shows clear/significant patterns" (or both don't, or one does and the other doesn't) is not generally very useful.

Similar to the LM, the GLM model showed there is no clear pattern between alpha diversity and age (p-value = 0.217). There are no non-linear relationships between diversity and age and there is a normal distribution within the data, as visualized with the residuals vs fitted and normal q-q plots.

**BMB*: as JD said today in class - avoid saying "there is a normal distribution of the data". (Say something like "there aren't large departures from normality" instead.)

Again, heteroscedasticity does not seem to appear because the residuals are randomnly spread. An interesting thing to note would be more outliers within the residuals vs leverage plot that lie outside of the Cook's distance line. Again, these outliers should be removed to investigate how they may influence the data but I predict they may not have a large influence.

Secondly, the GLM shows there is a clear pattern between alpha diversity and sample type collected (p-value = 0.0245), which was previously seen with the LM. The diagnostic plots for the GLM are quite similar to the LM. Again, since the predictor variable is categorical, the residuals are diverged onto opposite ends of the plot with a horizontal line indicating there are no non-linear relationships in the data. The normal Q-Q plot indicates normal distribution and the scale - location plot shows equal variance or no heteroscedasticity present. Lastly, there are quite a few outliers in the residual vs leverage plot that should be removed but I would predict they would not influence the data greatly.

**BMB**: why do you conclude that there are lots of outliers? As far as I can see the Cook's distance=0.5 contour doesn't even appear on these plots (meaning that all of the values are within the typical threshold of concern). Furthermore, removing outliers is a last resort.  Outliers should be *examined*/understood (can we come up with any reason this point might be an outlier? Do we think it represents something biological/real, or is it likely to be a technical error of some sort? Is there anything we can do to account for it, or to downweight its influence, if we think that influence is inappropriate?)
